<p1>
1. <br>a) Study of Unix/Linux general purpose utility command list: man, who, cat, cd,
cp, ps, ls, mv, rm, mkdir, rmdir, echo, more, date, time, kill, history, chmod,
chown, finger, pwd, cal, logout, shutdown.<br>
b) Study of Bash shell, Bourne shell and C shell in Unix/Linux operating system.<br>
c) Study of Unix/Linux file system (tree structure).<br>
d) Study of .bashrc, /etc/bashrc and Environment variables.<br>
2. <br>a) Use the cat command to create a file containing the following data.Call it
mytable use tabs to separatethe fields.<br>
1425     Ravi     15.65<br>
4320     Ramu    26.27<br>
6830     Sita      36.15<br>
1450    Raju      21.86<br>
b) Study of vi editor<br>
c) Use the cat command to display the file, my table.<br>
d) Use the vi command to correct any errors in the file, my table.<br>
e) Use the sort command to sort the file my table according to the first field.<br>
Call the sorted file my table (same name).<br>
f) Print the file my table.<br>
3.<br>
a) Write a C program that makes a copy of a file using standard I/O, and system
calls.<br>
b) Write a C program to emulate the UNIX ls –l command.<br>
c) Write a C program that illustrates how to execute two commands concurrently<br>
with a command pipe. Ex: - ls –l | sort.<br>
4. Shell Script<br>
a) Write a shell script that takes a command –line argument and reports on
whether it is directory, a file or something else.<br>
b) Write a shell script that accepts one or more file name as arguments and
converts all of them to uppercase provided they exist in the current directory.<br>
5. Shell Script<br>
a) Write a shell script that determines the period for which a specified user is
working on the system.<br>
b) Write a shell script that accepts a file name starting and ending line numbers
as arguments and displays all the lines between the given line numbers.<br>
6. Shell Script<br>
Write a shell script that computes the gross salary of a employee according to the
following rules:<br>
i) If basic salary is < 1500 then HRA =10% of the basic and DA =90% of the
basic.<br>
ii) If basic salary is >=1500 then HRA =Rs500 and DA=98% of the basic. The
basic salary is entered interactively through the key board.<br>
7. Shell Script<br>
a) Write a shell script that accepts two integers as its arguments and computes
the value of first number raised to the power of the second number.<br>
b) Write a shell script which will display Armstrong number from given
arguments.<br>
8. Shell Script<br>
Write an interactive file-handling shell program. Let it offer the user the
choice of copying, removing, renaming, or linking files. Once the user has
made a choice, have the program ask the user for the necessary information,
such as the file name, new name and so on.<br>
9.<br> a) Write shell script that takes a login name as command – line argument and
reports when that person logs in.<br>
b) Write a shell script which receives two file names as arguments. It should
check whether the two file contents are same or not. If they are same then
second file should be deleted.<br>
10. <br>Write a C program that takes one or more file or directory names as a
command line input and reports the following information on the file:<br>
i) File type.<br>
ii) Number of links.<br>
iii) Read, write and execute permissions.<br>
iv) Time of last access (Note : Use stat/fstat system calls).<br>
11. <br>Write a C program which supports that child process inherits environment
variables, command line arguments, opened’files.<br>
12. <br>Write a shell script to display factorial value from given argument list.<br>
